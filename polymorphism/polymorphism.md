# Polymorphism in Golang

Polymorphism in **Golang** is achieved through **interfaces**. Unlike traditional object-oriented languages like Java or C++, Go does not use class-based inheritance. Instead, it relies on interfaces to achieve polymorphism.

## üîÅ What is Polymorphism?

Polymorphism allows writing code that can work with different types through a common interface. It lets you treat different types uniformly if they implement the same behavior.

Interfaces in Go are implicit ‚Äì types implement interfaces just by having the required methods.

The empty interface (interface{}) can hold values of any type, but it's not type-safe.

Interface-based polymorphism promotes decoupled, testable, and clean code design.
